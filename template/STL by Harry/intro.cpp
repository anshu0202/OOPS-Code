/*
STL ->Standard Template Library
It is basically Library of generic classes and Function
HP company k 2 employee Alexandar and Mengliy has created library
Why STL?
ans-> Help us to reuse existing classes and functions 
STL is used because its a good idea to reinvent the wheel
it help us to save time
Components of STL
1)Containers--> It is a object which stores data  e.g vector which use template class
2)Algorithm--> set of procedure  e.g algo of searching nd sorting which use template function
3)Iterators--> object which points to an element of a container  it is handled just like pointers
it connects algo with container
***************************************************
Types of container
1)Sequence containers-->store data linearly  eg. list,dequeue(double ended queue),vector
2)Associative containers-->provide faster(direct) access to data eg. set,multiset, map,multimap,dictionary
it store data in tree like structure
3)Derived containers-->help in real world modeling eg.stack, queue, priority queue
*****************************************************************
When to use Which?
1)Sequence containers
a)vector->random access is fast but insertion and deletion is slow but insertion at the end is fast
b)List->Random access is slow but insertion in the middle is fast
2)Associative containers
all operation are fast except random access it store data in tree data structure
3)Derived containers
depends upon the data structure used
